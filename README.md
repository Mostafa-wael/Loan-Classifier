# Loan-Classifier
A machine leaning bases loaan classifier using many classification techniques such as: 
- K Nearest Neighbor(KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Support Vector Machine
- Logistic Regression

the notebook uses all the previous techniques trying to find the best parameters for each one of them then, compares between them according to various metrics such as:
- jaccard similarity score
- f1 score
- log loss

this project serves as the final project in the " machine learning with python" course by IBM
